# A theory is a claim about WHY something happens, or about what is true of
# these systems. State it as a finding, not as an instruction: "Batch
# normalization helps by smoothing the optimization landscape" rather than
# "Use batch normalization". If what you are about to write tells the reader
# what to do in machine learning, it is a practice, and it belongs in the
# Anthology of the SOTA (ANTH-ADR-031).

# Active | Proposed | Deferred | Superseded | Rejected, optionally " — note".
# What each one means here is in luria.yaml, and it is NOT what the same word
# means on a practice: this status says whether the record believes the
# ACCOUNT, and an explanation can be `Rejected` while the thing it explained
# goes on working exactly as well as it ever did.
status: Proposed

# REQUIRED while the status is Proposed or Deferred; delete it when the
# explanation goes Active. What would settle it — a KIND of result, not a
# quantity of them (ANTH-ADR-014). An explanation that cannot say what would show
# it wrong is a story, and this field is where that shows up.

# entry in `source:` below, and writing it down is a lint violation, because
# the value has one home and this is not it.

# REQUIRED, and a LIST. The papers this account rests on, primary first. An
# explanation with no paper behind it is a hunch, and the lint will say so.

# THEORY-NNN: What is true, stated as a finding

## Source

Author et al. (YEAR), LIT-000.

## What was actually shown

The experiment or argument, and its conditions. An explanation is only as
good as what would have falsified it, so say what the paper did that could
have come out the other way.

## What this does not say

The reading the result invites and does not support. This section is the one
that earns the document — a finding filed without it becomes the stronger
claim nobody checked, which is how "sharpness correlates with test error"
gets cited as "flatten the minimum and it generalizes".
