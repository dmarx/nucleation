# A NOTE is a READING of a paper: what it contains, what it assumes, what it
# proves, and how strongly. It is not the paper's standing in this record
# — that is the LIT note's job, and the two are allowed to disagree
# (ANTH-ADR-025).

# Read | Skimmed | Unread | Superseded, from statuses.yaml beside this file.
# This says HOW DEEPLY THE PAPER WAS READ, not whether it is any good.
# Be honest here. `Skimmed` is a useful, respectable status and is
# deliberately not in force: it is not enough to source a practice from,
# and the whole scheme exists because the record could not previously tell
# a read paper from an unread one.
status: Skimmed

# REQUIRED. The LIT code this is a reading of. The bibliography — title,

# NOTE-xxx: <paper short name>

## Contribution

Two to four sentences. What did this add that did not exist before? Not what
field it is in — what is true after it that was not true before.

## Key insight

One paragraph. The single mental model this paper installs: the thing to
remember if everything else is forgotten.

## Assumptions

The formal conditions the main results require. State them as conditions,
with the expressions where they have them.

- `L`-smooth gradients: ‖∇f(x) − ∇f(y)‖ ≤ L‖x − y‖
- Bounded stochastic variance: E[‖g − ∇f‖²] ≤ σ²
- IID data across workers, or the heterogeneity bound if not

Where a paper's setting is narrower than its title suggests, say so here
rather than letting a reader assume it transfers.

## Key results

Theorem-level, with the **exact expressions**. `O(1/√(nK))` is more useful
than "converges at the same rate as centralized". Give the regime each holds
in.

- **Theorem 1** — statement. *Holds when:* the parameter regime.

## Claims

Only a `Read` note may fill this in. `strength` is about the *support*, not
about how much you believe it.

| id | claim | strength | support |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | plain English | strong / moderate / weak | Theorem 2 / experiment in §5 / informal argument |

## Method

*(Omit this section entirely for empirical or survey papers.)*

The algorithm, its steps, and its components.

## Concepts

Terms as *this paper* defines them, which is not always as the field uses
them.

- **term** — precise definition as used here.

## Connections

How this builds on prior work, in prose. Machine-readable lineage —
`extends:`, `corrects:`, `compared_against:` — is declared on the LIT and
must not be duplicated here.

## Bearing on the record

Which THEORY documents this reading supports, contradicts, or should
produce. Name the codes. If a document cites this paper for something the
paper does not say, this is where that gets written down. If the paper
carries an instruction for machine-learning practice, it belongs in the
Anthology of the SOTA, and this is where that is noted.

## Limitations

What the paper does not establish, including what its own authors say it
does not.

## Open questions

What it leaves open, and what result would close it.
