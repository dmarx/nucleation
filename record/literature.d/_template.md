# A note records why a paper is worth keeping. It is not a summary of the
# paper; it is this project's reading of it.

# Active | Proposed | Deferred | Superseded | Rejected, optionally " — note".
# See statuses.yaml beside this file. `Rejected` is the attic: retire a paper
# by setting it, with the reason in the status note and the long version
# under "Standing in the record" below. Never by deleting the file —
# something cites it.
status: Active

# The paper's title, verbatim. Repeat it as the body's `# LIT-NNN:` heading.
title: 'The paper title, exactly as published'

version: 1

# One or more of the topics in luria.yaml (vocabularies.topics), primary first.
# The vocabulary is closed: a word it lacks is added by decision, not invented.

# REQUIRED. When the PAPER appeared — the arXiv posting month, from the id:
# 2205.11487 → 2022-05. Distinct from `date:` above, which is when the record
# got round to it.
#
# This is the one place the date lives. A practice reads it from its primary
# source and a reading note from its paper, both by `derive`/`from` in
# luria.yaml, so neither carries a copy that could drift (see the anthology's issue 119).
published: '2022-05-01'

# A SOURCE is required — at least one of these three, enforced (ANTH-ADR-009).
# Prefer them in this order: an arXiv id or a DOI resolves through a remote
# and can be pinned; a URL is a string nothing can check. Bare id, no
# version suffix. Delete the lines you don't use.

## Key takeaways

- What it establishes, in claims rather than topics.

## Standing in the record

Why this is here — or, once it is `Rejected` or `Superseded`, why it isn't
any more, and what replaced it. Omit the section entirely while the answer is
just "it's good work", which is the usual case.
