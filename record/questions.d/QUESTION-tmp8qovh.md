summary: >-
  A1 and A2 of the exchange of 2026-10-19 on coarse-to-fine processes. The
  record already holds that "coarse to fine" names different things: an
  order in training time by singular value ([THEORY-186](../theory.d/THEORY-186.md)), an order in
  noise ([THEORY-199](../theory.d/THEORY-199.md)), and a sample-complexity result in which every
  level arrives at once ([THEORY-195](../theory.d/THEORY-195.md)). No entry separates refinement,
  relevance and acquisition as three relations and asks when they agree.
  An answer is a theorem giving sufficient conditions for a common chain,
  or a minimal family of counterexamples.

# QUESTION-tmp8qovh: When a learning system is said to go from coarse to fine, do the order in which its representations refine one another, the order of their relevance to a task and the order in which training acquires them admit one common chain, and under what conditions on the learning operator?

## Why it is a question

A2 of the exchange of 2026-10-19 separated three relations on a family of
representations Z_ℓ:

- **refinement**: Z_a is a function of Z_b (σ(Z_a) ⊆ σ(Z_b));
- **relevance**: Z_b is at least as informative about a stated target;
- **acquisition**: the distinctions in Z_a become recoverable no later in
  training than those in Z_b, with an acquisition time
  T_ℓ(δ) = inf{t : R(D_{ℓ,t}, Z_ℓ) ≤ δ} for a decoder D and a risk R.

"The information ordering and the acquisition ordering must be represented
separately. The first is structural. The second is dynamical." A coarse-to-
fine schedule is the case where the three admit a common monotone chain.
A2: "Crucially, the default should not be to assume these orderings agree."

## What the record holds

- [THEORY-186](../theory.d/THEORY-186.md): in a deep linear network the order is by singular
  value, and "Fine distinctions come first whenever the data make them
  stronger". So acquisition and refinement can be reversed. It is exact
  only for decoupled, balanced starts and white inputs.
- [THEORY-086](../theory.d/THEORY-086.md): in the kernel regime the order is by NTK eigenvalue,
  "not by degree".
- [THEORY-481](../theory.d/THEORY-481.md): in linear attention the order is by input variance,
  with alignment to the eigenbasis assumed, and at finite context the
  modes couple at order 1/N.
- [THEORY-199](../theory.d/THEORY-199.md), [THEORY-195](../theory.d/THEORY-195.md) and [NOTE-687](../notes.d/NOTE-687.md): orders in noise and in sample
  size that run opposite to [THEORY-186](../theory.d/THEORY-186.md)'s, and "should not be cited as
  one account".

What the record lacks is the condition under which a spectral order is a
refinement order. A2's candidate ("Conjecture A", in its words "a
candidate research direction, not an established theorem"): let P_ℓ
project onto the observables of level ℓ. If the learning operator A
nearly commutes with every P_ℓ ([A, P_ℓ] ≈ 0) and its effective
eigenvalues fall as finer distinctions are added, acquisition is nearly
coarse to fine, with deviations set by the cross-level coupling and the
spectral gaps. For a moving operator A_t it proposed
∫‖[A_t, P_ℓ]‖ dt ≪ 1 as the measure.

## What would count as an answer

- A theorem giving sufficient conditions, for a stated model class, under
  which the three relations share a chain; or
- a small family of constructions in which each pair comes apart. One is
  already on file: [THEORY-186](../theory.d/THEORY-186.md)'s fine-first case.

A2's first project would test it: synthetic data with a known tree, with
the spectral strength assigned to each level varied independently of the
tree, trained in a deep linear network, a kernel-regime network and a small
nonlinear one, reporting a phase diagram of coarse-first, fine-first,
simultaneous and mixed acquisition. Readings registered with this question:
spectral bias ([LIT-tmpzunec](../literature.d/LIT-tmpzunec.md)), slow feature analysis ([LIT-tmpf5lvd](../literature.d/LIT-tmpf5lvd.md)),
diffusion maps ([LIT-tmpc7k0w](../literature.d/LIT-tmpc7k0w.md)) and diffusion wavelets ([LIT-tmptogwd](../literature.d/LIT-tmptogwd.md)), and the
information geometry of coarse-graining ([LIT-tmpokskn](../literature.d/LIT-tmpokskn.md)). Whether optimal
representations nest at all is [QUESTION-tmpproc1](QUESTION-tmpproc1.md).
