  Take a centered Gaussian process on a finite set T with max variance σ²
  and minimum separation a. The expected softmax-weighted average g(β) =
  E[Σ_t X_t e^{βX_t}/Z] satisfies g(β) ≤ √(2σ²·E D(ν_β‖ν₀)) for every β
  (Thm 1, D = KL from uniform). For β ≥ β*, g(β) ≥ c·a·√(E D(ν_β‖ν₀)),
  with c the Sudakov constant (1/17 via Marcus–Rosen) (Thm 2). For i.i.d.
  N(0,σ²) logits there is an exact identity, g(β) = βσ²(1 − E‖ν_β‖²₂)
  (Lemma 2). The quenched free energy is bounded above by √(2σ²·E
  D_{1/2}(ν_β‖ν₀)), with an i.i.d. lower bound of (cσ/2)√(E D_{1/2}) (Thms
  4–5).

# NOTE-046: Chu & Raginsky, expected soft maxima of Gaussian processes

## Contribution

The classical two-sided bound a√log|T| ≲ E max_t X_t ≲ Δ√log|T| (Eq. 1) is extended to finite inverse temperature β. For the two smooth proxies of the maximum, the paper identifies which quantity plays the role of log|T| at finite β:
- for the Gibbs average g(β), the expected KL divergence of the Gibbs measure from uniform, E D(ν_β‖ν₀) = log|T| − E H(ν_β);
- for the quenched free energy φ(β), the expected Rényi-½ divergence E D_{1/2}(ν_β‖ν₀).

Both reduce to √log|T| as β → ∞. The authors believe the finite-β bounds are new (§1.1). They differ from Liu (2022, 2023), who bounds log-integral relaxations of convex-body widths for non-Gaussian linear processes.

## Key insight

Two tools, one for each direction.
- **Upper bound.** By the Gibbs variational principle, the softmax average ⟨X⟩_β is a Legendre dual of the log-partition function. So ⟨X⟩_β ≤ (1/λ)·D(ν_β‖ν₀) + φ(λ) for any λ, and the Gaussian moment generating function bounds φ(λ) ≤ λσ²/2. Optimising over λ gives √(2σ²·D).
- **Lower bound.** By Gaussian integration by parts, g(β) is an exact function of the replica overlap. It equals (β/2)·Σ_{s,t} d²(s,t)·E[ν_β(s)ν_β(t)]. At low temperature this lets Sudakov minoration at β = ∞ be propagated backwards to finite β by a monotonicity argument.

The one thing to remember: **for i.i.d. Gaussian logits, the expected softmax-weighted logit is exactly βσ² times one minus the expected collision probability** (Lemma 2, Eq. 12).

## Assumptions

- X = (X_t)_{t∈T} is a **centered Gaussian process on a finite index set T**.
- d(s,t) = (E|X_s − X_t|²)^{1/2} is a metric, not a pseudometric: E|X_s − X_t|² > 0 for s ≠ t (p. 2). So all X_t are a.s. distinct and ν_β tends to a Dirac mass as β → ∞.
- σ² = max_t Var X_t. a = min separation. Δ = diameter.
- Theorems 3 and 5 additionally assume that the X_t are **i.i.d. N(0, σ²)**. Then a² = Δ² = 2σ².
- Theorem 6 needs a 4σ-packing S of (T, d).
- Nothing about the logits being produced by a network, or about the values being averaged differing from the logits. The averaged quantity in g is the logit X_t itself.

## Key results

- **Eqs. 2, 4.** max X_t ≤ (1/β) log Σ e^{βX_t} ≤ max X_t + log|T|/β, and max X_t − log|T|/β ≤ g(X;β) ≤ max X_t.
- **Eqs. 8–10.**
  - D(ν_β‖ν₀) = log|T| − H(ν_β) = log|T| + β⟨X⟩_β − Λ(β), with Λ = log Z.
  - D_α(ν_β‖ν₀) = log|T| + (Λ(αβ) − αΛ(β))/(α−1).
  - D_{1/2}(ν_β‖ν₀) = log|T| + log‖ν_{β/2}‖²₂.
- **Lemma 1.** β ↦ ‖ν_β‖²₂ (the participation ratio, i.e. e^{−H₂(ν_β)}) is nondecreasing. Its derivative is 2‖ν_β‖²₂(Λ′(2β) − Λ′(β)) ≥ 0.
- **Lemma 2 (replica-symmetric representation).** g(β) = (β/2)·Σ_{s,t} d²(s,t)·E[ν_β(s)ν_β(t)] = (β/2)·E⟨d²(τ¹,τ²)⟩_β.
  - For i.i.d. N(0,σ²) logits: **g(β) = βσ²(1 − r(β))**, with r(β) = E‖ν_β‖²₂ nondecreasing.
- **Theorem 1.** g(β) ≤ √(2σ²·E D(ν_β‖ν₀)) for all β ≥ 0.
  - Corollary 1 writes this as √(2σ²(log|T| − E H(ν_β))), which recovers E max ≤ √(2σ² log|T|) as β → ∞.
- **Theorem 2.** There exists 0 < β* < ∞, depending on the covariance, with g(β) ≥ c·a·√(E D(ν_β‖ν₀)) for all β ≥ β*. The constant c is Sudakov's (Eq. 14).
- **Theorem 3 (i.i.d.).** As stated: g(β) ≥ cσ√(E D) for all β ≥ 0. As proved: that constant holds for β > β*, and cσ/√2 holds for β ≤ β* (see corrections).
- **Theorem 4.** φ(β) ≤ √(2σ²·E D_{1/2}(ν_β‖ν₀)).
  - Proof: integrate Theorem 1 through ψ(β) = βφ(β), with ψ′ = g, and use Jensen and the convexity of ψ.
- **Theorem 5 (i.i.d.).** φ(β) ≥ (cσ/2)·√(E D_{1/2}(ν_β‖ν₀)) for all β ≥ 0 (as stated; see corrections).
- **Theorem 6 (no independence).** If S is a 4σ-packing, then E Φ_β(X; ∪_s B(s,σ)) ≥ σ·E Φ_{βσ}(G; S) + (1/|S|)·Σ_s E Φ_β(X; B(s,σ)), with G i.i.d. N(0,1).
  - As β → ∞ this recovers Talagrand's (1992) minoration for finite T.
- **Theorem 7 (REM).** Energies are i.i.d. N(0, N/2) on {±1}^N. There are explicit piecewise functions Q̲_N ≤ P_N(β) ≤ inf_{β₀} Q̄_N(β; β₀) for each finite N, with a threshold β*_N.
  - Each bound is quadratic in β below its breakpoint. Above it, the lower bound is linear in β, and the upper bound is linear up to the slowly varying factor √(E D(ν_{N,β}‖ν_{N,0})/N) ≤ √log 2 (Remark 2). The constants are not sharp.
  - Choosing β₀ = β_c = 2√log 2 in the upper bound gives log 2 + β²/4 below β_c and ≤ β√log 2 above it, the correct upper bound at every N (Remark 2).
  - The limit law with the phase transition at β_c is cited to Giardinà–Starr. It is not proved here.

## Method

This is a proof paper and there is no algorithm. It uses four techniques:
- the Gibbs variational principle (Donsker–Varadhan duality) for the upper bounds;
- Gaussian integration by parts, giving the replica-symmetric representation;
- Sudakov minoration at β = ∞, propagated to finite β by showing that g(β) − ca√(E D) is nonincreasing beyond β*;
- the fundamental theorem of calculus through ψ(β) = βφ(β), with ψ′ = g, to move from Gibbs averages to free energies.

## Concepts

- **β-softmax** — Φ_β(X; A) = (1/β) log Σ_{t∈A} e^{βX_t} (log-sum-exp at inverse temperature β; §4.3).
- **Gibbs average g(X;β)** — Σ_t X_t e^{βX_t}/Z(β). This is the softmax-weighted mean of the logits themselves. It runs from the sample mean (β=0) to the max (β→∞).
- **Quenched** — the expectation over the disorder X is taken after the Gibbs average: g(β) = E g(X;β), and φ(β) = (1/β)·E log((1/|T|)·Σ e^{βX_t}).
- **Gibbs measure ν_β** — softmax(βX) as a random measure on T. ν₀ is uniform.
- **Participation ratio** — ‖ν_β‖²₂ = Z(2β)/Z(β)² = e^{−H₂(ν_β)}. It is the collision probability of two independent softmax draws.
- **Replicas** — τ¹, τ² drawn i.i.d. from ν_β for a fixed X.

## Connections

- The proofs rely on standard sources: Talagrand (2011, 2014) for generic chaining and Sudakov minoration, Panchenko (2013) and Talagrand (2011, Lemma 1.3.11) for replica-symmetric representations in the SK model, Chatterjee (2014) for superconcentration and Gaussian interpolation, Bovier (2006) and Mézard–Montanari (2009) for the REM.
- The closest prior work is Liu (2022, 2023). Liu bounds E log ∫ e^{⟨t,Y⟩}µ(dt) over convex bodies, with Y not necessarily Gaussian.
- The Rényi–free-energy link is cited to Baez (2022).
- Nothing in this record connects to it yet. It is a mathematics/probability work filed in an information-theory context because of its KL/Rényi characterisation.

## Bearing on the record

For this record: no THEORY document here is supported or contradicted. It is a clean probability result and needs no further action here.

**For the Anthology of the SOTA, which the brief asks about specifically.** It carries no instruction and no ML claim. "Attention" and "transformer" never appear, "softmax" names only the log-sum-exp (Eq. 2, §4.3), and "neural" occurs only in the grant titles of the acknowledgments. But it does contain something an ML theory document could use, and I would flag it as a **possible, weak anthology boundary work**:
- **Attention with Gaussian scores.** g(X;β) is exactly the expected attended *score* under softmax attention whose scores are Gaussian, for example at initialization with random queries and keys. It is not the attended *value*, which weights separate V vectors. So the direct transfer is limited to "how large is the logit the softmax lands on".
  - Lemma 2 gives, for i.i.d. N(0,σ²) scores, E[Σ p_t s_t] = βσ²(1 − E Σ p_t²) exactly. That is an exact link between attention sharpness (Rényi-2 collision probability) and score scale.
  - Theorem 1 gives, for any Gaussian scores, E[Σ p_t s_t] ≤ √(2σ²(log n − E H(p))). A given expected attended score therefore forces an entropy deficit from uniform of at least g²/(2σ²).
- **Length and temperature.** The REM section (restated, not proved here) implies a condensation threshold. With energy variance N/2 over n = 2^N items, condensation sets in at β_c = 2√log 2, i.e. at βσ = √(2 ln n) in the paper's scaling (my translation). So softmax over i.i.d. Gaussian scores stays diffuse unless inverse temperature × score scale grows like √(2 ln n).
  - That is a mathematically clean version of why attention needs a temperature that grows with sequence length. It is the Gaussian counterpart of the bounded-logit dispersion argument in [ANTH-THEORY-098](https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-the-sota/blob/main/record/theory.d/THEORY-098.md) (Veličković et al., [ANTH-LIT-653](https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-the-sota/blob/main/record/literature.d/LIT-653.md)).
  - It sits beside [ANTH-THEORY-061](https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-the-sota/blob/main/record/theory.d/THEORY-061.md) (attention entropy lower-bounded via the spectral norm of the QK product) and the practices [ANTH-SOTA-050](https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-the-sota/blob/main/record/practices.d/SOTA-050.md) (1/√d scaling) and [ANTH-SOTA-192](https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-the-sota/blob/main/record/practices.d/SOTA-192.md) (QK normalization).
- **Recommendation.** Do not file it in the anthology on its own. Name it in prose as supporting mathematics if and when the anthology writes a THEORY document on softmax temperature versus number of items. The phase-transition fact itself is Derrida's REM and is not this paper's result.

## Limitations

- The index set must be finite and the process exactly Gaussian. There is no heavy-tail or sub-Gaussian version and no infinite-T version (generic chaining at finite β is not attempted).
- The low-temperature lower bound needs a non-constructive threshold β*. So Theorem 2 gives no usable bound at any specified β outside the i.i.d. case.
- Theorem 3's printed constant exceeds the proved one by √2 for β ≤ β*. Theorem 5 inherits this.
- The i.i.d. matching bounds do not extend to correlated processes. Only the free-energy minoration (Thm 6) goes beyond independence.
- The REM bounds are explicitly not sharp. The phase-transition limit is quoted, not derived.
- The abstract's "learning theory" motivation is not developed anywhere in the text.

## Open questions

- Can β* be made explicit in terms of the covariance, for example via a, Δ and |T|? That would turn Theorem 2 into a usable finite-temperature bound.
- Does g(β) ≍ σ√(E D(ν_β‖ν₀)) hold for weakly correlated or equicorrelated logits? A chaining argument at finite β would settle it.
- Is there a generic-chaining analogue at finite β, i.e. a finite-temperature γ₂ functional?
- For ML use: does the same KL-from-uniform characterisation hold when the averaged vector (values) differs from the scores? That is the attention-output case, and the paper does not treat it.

## Corrections to the seeded skim

- The dossier gives the headline bounds only up to ≲/≳. The constants are explicit, and one matters. Theorem 1 is g(β) ≤ √(2σ²·E D(ν_β‖ν₀)), with the sharp √2 that recovers E max ≤ √(2σ² log|T|) (Eq. 13). Theorem 2's constant is exactly the Sudakov constant c of Eq. 14. The paper quotes c = 1/17 from Marcus–Rosen Lemma 5.5.6.
- The threshold β* in Theorem 2 is **not constructive**. The proof (p. 9) only shows that some β* exists. It is the point beyond which 1 − r(β) ≤ c²a²/(2Δ²), where r(β) = E‖ν_β‖²₂ and Δ is the diameter. Existence follows because r is nondecreasing (Lemma 1) and tends to 1. The paper gives no expression or estimate for β*. The dossier asked "how it depends on covariance". The answer is: only through this implicit condition on r, a and Δ.
- Theorem 3 (i.i.d. lower bound "for all β ≥ 0") has a constant slip that the dossier could not see. The theorem states g(β) ≥ cσ√(E D). The proof's high-temperature branch (p. 10) delivers g(β) ≥ cσ√(½·E D), i.e. constant c/√2. Remark 1 calls this "the worse constant c/2", which is c/2 in units of a = √2σ. So the statement as printed overstates the proved constant for β ≤ β* by a factor √2. Theorem 5 inherits the statement's constant (ψ ≥ βg/2 ≥ (cβσ/2)√(E D)). Its proved constant is therefore cσ/(2√2), not cσ/2. The orders of magnitude and the ≍ claims are unaffected.
- The dossier's question "whether the i.i.d. matching extends to weakly correlated logits" is not addressed anywhere in the paper. Its only result without independence (Theorem 6, §4.3) is a Talagrand-type lower bound on the β-softmax (1/β)·E log Σ e^{βX_t}, i.e. on the free energy. It is not a bound on g(β).
- The dossier's summary says the free energy "scales likewise with the Rényi-½ divergence". Only the upper bound is general (Thm 4). The matching lower bound is i.i.d.-only (Thm 5).
